Most distributions force a choice between a bloated "friendly" UI or a hollow "minimal" base. RAINING-OS rejects that compromise. We ship a pre-hardened system with a custom C-compiled security plane, optimized for users who want invisible protection and a "stunning" desktop environment without the manual ricing labor.

Key Features
Security Stack 

RAINING-OS includes a multi-layered defense suite that monitors system integrity without user intervention.

Integrity Monitoring: rkhunter and chkrootkit configured via systemd timers.

Malware Analysis: maldet and ClamAV with optimized scan intervals.

Runtime Auditing: Falco for real-time kernel event monitoring.

Isolation: Firejail sandboxing for high-risk applications.

Access Control: Hardened AppArmor profiles active by default.

Performance

Liquorix Kernel: Zen-interactive tuned kernel for low-latency desktop use and gaming. (FOR DESKTOP ONLY)

Minimal Overhead: Stripped-back background services; only what is essential for security and stability remains.

Ricing & UX

Department Lead: APRIL

Gnome: Highly customized, performance-tuned environment.

Ready-to-Use: No "Stock Gnome" bloat. Modern layout, customized shaders, and low-latency input profiles are standard.

Installation
Plan to release usable ISO by FEB 2026

Roadmap


[ ] Transition to custom-built SELinux profiles.

Contributing
